# Performance.gov Cover Sheet Project

## Introduction 

This project is an exploration into the potential of automating the collection and analysis of performance reporting information for [Agency Priority Goals (APGs)](https://trumpadministration.archives.performance.gov/about/APG_about.html#:~:text=Agency%20Priority%20Goals%20(APGs)%20are,drive%20significant%20progress%20and%20change.). The dataset is derived from a "cover sheet", which is a new initiative being explored for collecting performance reporting data from CFO Act agencies that enables more candidness about goal progress and, therefore, has potential for better business intelligence. This project includes both the code needed to collect data from an input of cover sheet files and the implementation of generating a piece of business intelligence based on the collected information. 

The team tasked with developing [Performance.gov](https://www.performance.gov/) within the [GSA's Office of Shared Solutions and Performance Improvement (OSSPI)](https://www.gsa.gov/governmentwide-initiatives/shared-solutions-and-performance-improvement) heads this project and its development.
